# Project Description
# Telling stories with Tableau
This data comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.
It entails the data visualization of flight delays and cancellations using Tableau. 
The three(3) datasets; flight.csv, airlines.csv and airport.csv used in the visualization were merged together before insights were drawn into the data.
# Questions asked
* Number of flights in each state
* How many airlines were diverted and canceled?
* Departure delay of airlines over state and airline.

# Visualization 1:Number of flights in each state
![Sheet 3 (1)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96656540/212534172-dd34de56-9a3c-4aa1-8765-b3e0cbe3f148.png)

The map shows the number of flights and states. That is the number of flights that
arrived in various states in the USA in 2015. Apparently, California(CA) had the
highest number of flights at 32,905, with Texas(TX) having the next highest number
of flights at 31,924. At the other end of the spectrum, American Samoa had the
lowest number of flights at 2.

# Visualization 2- How many airlines were diverted and canceled?
![Sheet 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96656540/212534400-2c2d094f-353f-4571-b7bb-63ef4d0f8017.png)

The scatterplot shows the relationship between the sum of diverted and cancelled
flights in various airlines. The cancelled was plotted on the y-axis and diverted on the
x-axis while the airline was used to form a relationship between the two variables. It
appears that the two variables do have a linear relationship with outliers but have a
strong positive correlation. From the scatterplot, HA(Hawaiian Airlines inc.) has both
low cancelled and diverted flights. WN(Southwest Airlines Co) has the highest
cancelled and diverted flights.

# Visualization 3- Departure delay of airlines over state and Airline
![Dashboard 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96656540/212534516-05b208f4-3544-4689-bff9-3dd4d29b3535.png)

Departure delay, state, and the airline were visualized in two worksheets and
connected to a dashboard. The state was used as a filter for both worksheets for
easy visibility.
For the first visualization, a map was used to show the departure delay, state and
airline. Airline AA and the state of Texas had the highest departure delay.
For the second visualization, a bar chart was used to check for the highest departure
delay over the state. The state of CA has the highest departure delay.
