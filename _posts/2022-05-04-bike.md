## Project Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bicycle-sharing systems are used.

This project gives a detailed explanation of how bike users interact with the technological systems and gives a track of the number of bikes used per day. 

## Project Overview
* Imported over 1000 data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics.
* Wrangled the dataset using Python and its packages.
* Explored the use of Python to compare bicycle-share systems in three major cities in the United states-Chicago, New York City, and Washington.
* Wrote a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
