Hello! I'm Sakinah, a data analyst. I'm skilled in various software tools such as Python, R, Tableau, SQL. I love analyzing and intrepreting complex data through data collection, data wrangling, data cleaning and data visualization. I'm currently working on several mini data science projects cut across different industries.
I love how data can be used to tell stories and to make smarter data-driven decisions through valuable insights.
