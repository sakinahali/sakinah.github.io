title: About Me

Hello! I'm Sakinah and I'm a data analyst/scientist. I'm currently working on several mini data science projects cut across different industries. 
I love how data can be used to tell stories and to make smarter data-driven decisions through valuable insights.
I'm open to collaborations on meaningful projects.
