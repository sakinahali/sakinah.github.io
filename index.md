Hello! I'm Sakinah and I'm a data analyst/scientist. I'm currently working on several mini data science projects cut across different industries. 
I love how data can be used to tell stories and derive valuable insights to make smarter data driven decisions.
I'm open to collaborations on meaningful projects.
