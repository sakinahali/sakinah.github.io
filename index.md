<p>Hi, I'm Ali Sakinah E, a data analyst who is passionate about data. With 1+ years of experience in data analysis, I have developed a strong skillset in analyzing complex data sets, creating data visualizations, and developing actionable insights that help organizations make data-driven decisions.

In addition, I have also taken on leadership roles, mentoring and coaching others to develop their data analysis skills and become more effective leaders. .

As a data analyst, I have also had the privilege of working with several projects, from healthcare and finance.
Through these experiences, I have seen firsthand the power of data in transforming organizations and improving outcomes for communities.
