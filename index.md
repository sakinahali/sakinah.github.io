---

<p>I love using data in making better decisions. I graduated with a Bachelor's in Industrial Chemistry from the University of Port Harcourt, Rivers Nigeria. I pivoted into Data Analytics in 2022 and gradually moved to Data Science and Machine Learning using self-paced online platforms such as Coursera, Udacity, and DataCamp. With a background in Chemistry, I have successfully worked on multi-disciplinary projects using frameworks in Python such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit Learn, Plotly, and Visualization tools like Tableau. </p> 

<p>When I am not writing codes or analyzing datasets. I love to read books on memoirs and contemporary poetry. </p>
