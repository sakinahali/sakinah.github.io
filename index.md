<p>Hi, I'm Ali Sakinah E, a data analyst who is passionate about data. With 1+ years of experience in data analysis, I have developed a strong skillset in analyzing complex data sets, creating data visualizations, and developing actionable insights that help organizations make data-driven decisions.

In addition, I have also taken on leadership roles, mentoring and coaching others to develop their data analysis skills and become more effective leaders. I firmly believe that by sharing our knowledge and skills, we can create a more equitable and just society.

As a data analyst, I have had the privilege of working with several projects, from healthcare and finance.
Through these experiences, I have seen firsthand the power of data in transforming organizations and improving outcomes for communities.

In my free time, you can often find me volunteering at local community events, participating in community_based research initiatives. I am committed to using my skills and knowledge to make positive impact in the world and inspire others to do same.</p>
